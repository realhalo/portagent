NAME
       portagent - proxy routing daemon for sharing ports

SYNOPSIS
       portagent -v
       portagent [file.conf]

DESCRIPTION
       portagent  is a POSIX transparent proxy routing daemon that allows mul-
       tiple arbitrary services to run on a single arbitrary  port.  The  main
       intention  of  portagent is for situations that need more services open
       to the world than open ports prohibit.

       portagent works by analyzing the first input sent to the proxy  (porta-
       gent)  then,  based on that input, forwards the connection to a defined
       location; this makes portagent more of an art than a science.   certain
       protocols  work  well  together, and the more services on a single port
       the more degradation may occur.

       some protocols expect the  client  to  send  data  first,  for  example
       http/80  sends  its request without expecting any data from the server,
       this is desired, and can be matched and forwarded immediately.  on  the
       other side a service like ssh/22 expects the server to send data first,
       for this portagent will 'tease' the client with a forwarded  connection
       (using  the  TRY instruction listed further on) so that the server will
       send data to the client in an attempt to invoke a response from  client
       to then be matched and forwarded.

       the  science  part of portagent comes into play when using multiple TRY
       instructions to attempt to invoke a response from the  client,  by  the
       second  TRY  instruction the connection will have invalid protocol data
       sent to it from the previous TRY, however this may or  may  not  matter
       depending on the protocol.  if a protocol is broken by this, it is usu-
       ally easily noticeable when debugging/testing a portagent config  file.

       portagent  config  options  have  the  following basic format: INSTRUC-
       TION_NAME 'instruction_value', where instruction_value may contain  the
       following escape codes: \\, \', \e, \v, \t, \r, \n, \xNN, and \NNN.

       portagent  config  files  themselves  have  a very flexible instruction
       hierarchy, a whole config file could be placed on one line with no spa-
       ces  if needed.  however, it is best understood in the following schema
       (format):

       (items  in  '[]'  indicate  they  are  not  required,  '...'  indicates
       allowance  for  multiple  hierarchy instances, '|' indicates one of two
       choices)

CONFIG DESCRIPTION
       LOGFILE 'filename'
              - info: located in root hierarchy.
              - info: has no hierarchy of its own.
              - info: single instance.
              - info: not required.

              sets a file to  write  connection  events  and  other  portagent
              related  information  to.  this file will be locked until porta-
              gent exits and any other instances of  portagent  will  exit  if
              they  attempt  to  access the same file.  the CHROOT instruction
              does not affect this instruction's path.


       PIDFILE 'filename'
              - info: located in root hierarchy.
              - info: has no hierarchy of its own.
              - info: single instance.
              - info: not required.

              sets a file to write the portagent background process  id  (pid)
              to.   this  file  will  be  locked until portagent exits and any
              other instances of portagent will exit if they attempt to access
              the  same  file.   the  CHROOT  instruction does not affect this
              instruction's path.


       CHROOT 'directory'
              - info: located in root hierarchy.
              - info: has no hierarchy of its own.
              - info: single instance.
              - info: not required.
              - info: need to run as root.

              sets a specified directory to chroot to once portagent is loaded
              and running.  this intended for security purposes, no files need
              to be accessed after the CHROOT instruction has  been  executed,
              so  any  blank  directory  will  do.   this instruction does not
              affect the paths of the LOGFILE or PIDFILE instructions.


       USER 'user_name|uid'
              - info: located in root hierarchy.
              - info: has no hierarchy of its own.
              - info: single instance.
              - info: not required.
              - info: need to run as root.

              switches the user id (uid) of portagent  after  all  ports  have
              been  binded  to  and all files have been loaded.  this intended
              for security purposes.


       GROUP 'group_name|gid'
              - info: located in root hierarchy.
              - info: has no hierarchy of its own.
              - info: single instance.
              - info: not required.
              - info: need to run as root.

              switches the group id (gid) of portagent after  all  ports  have
              been  binded  to  and all files have been loaded.  this intended
              for security purposes.


       LISTEN 'port'
              - info: located in root hierarchy.
              - info: has own hierarchy consisting of:
              WITH, BACKLOG, LIMIT, INITIAL BUFFER, QUEUE BUFFER, WRITE, TIME-
              OUT, IF, TRY, and USE.
              - info: multiple instances allowed.
              - info: required.

              sets  the port to bind to accept new connections and initializes
              all instructions that follow to  be  applied  to  the  specified
              port.  LISTEN  will  also complete the previous LISTEN block, if
              there is one.  (info: the protocol string representation can  be
              used  instead  of  the numeric port value, ie. 'http' instead of
              '80')


       WITH 'hostname|ip'
              - info: located in LISTEN hierarchy.
              - info: has no hierarchy of its own.
              - info: single instance.
              - info: not required.
              - info: default=any.

              sets hostname/ip to bind the specified port to.  for example, if
              '127.0.0.1' was used portagent would only allow incoming connec-
              tions to connect if they connected to 127.0.0.1.


       BACKLOG 'num'
              - info: located in LISTEN hierarchy.
              - info: has no hierarchy of its own.
              - info: single instance.
              - info: not required.
              - info: default=5.

              sets the number of allowed unhandled connections to be queued.


       LIMIT 'num'
              - info: located in LISTEN hierarchy.
              - info: has no hierarchy of its own.
              - info: single instance.
              - info: not required.
              - info: default=50.

              sets the total number of allowed  incoming  connections  on  the
              specified  port.  any connections after the specified limit will
              be dropped immediately.


       INITIAL BUFFER 'num|fmt'
              - info: located in LISTEN hierarchy.
              - info: has no hierarchy of its own.
              - info: single instance.
              - info: not required.
              - info: default=16k.

              sets the maximum size of the initial read buffer  per  incomming
              connection,  this  is what IF instructions are compared against.
              it should be noted that data can be dropped if  this  buffer  is
              not set appropriately, it should be set to the maximum amount of
              data that can be received before being passed to a USE  instruc-
              tion.   if  data is still coming in before a USE instruction has
              been hit the exceeding data will be dropped.   this  instruction
              can  be  specified  via an arbitrary number (assumed bytes) or a
              number followed by a B, K, M, or G.  (ie.  '8k'  would  be  8192
              bytes)


       QUEUE BUFFER 'num|fmt'
              - info: located in LISTEN hierarchy.
              - info: has no hierarchy of its own.
              - info: single instance.
              - info: not required.
              - info: default=unlimited.

              sets  the maximum size of the queue buffer per incomming connec-
              tion.  each connection has a send queue for situations where one
              side  can  send faster than the other can receive.  if the queue
              grows larger than the specified limit  the  connection  will  be
              dropped.   this  instruction  can  be specified via an arbitrary
              number (assumed bytes) or a number followed by a B, K, M, or  G.
              (ie. '8k' would be 8192 bytes)


       WRITE 'string'
              - info: located in LISTEN or TRY hierarchy.
              - info: has no hierarchy of its own.
              - info: multiple instances allowed.
              - info: not required.

              writes  the  specified  string  to  the incoming connection.  no
              new-line character is appended, all normal  escape  formats  are
              supported. (ie. '\r', '\n', '\xNN', '\NNN' and so on)


       TIMEOUT 'num'
              - info: located in LISTEN or TRY hierarchy.
              - info: has no hierarchy of its own.
              - info: multiple instances allowed.
              - info: not required.

              sets  the  number  of  seconds to wait for following IF instruc-
              tion(s) to match incoming input.  once the  specified  time  has
              passed  portagent  will  move  on to the next TRY instruction or
              drop the connection if it is the last.


       IF DEFINED 'protocol'
              - info: located in LISTEN or TRY hierarchy.
              - info: has own hierarchy consisting of:
              IP, IP NOT, PORT, and PORT NOT.
              - info: multiple instances allowed.
              - info: not required.

              if the incoming  connection's  initial  input/data  matches  the
              specified  pre-defined  protocol  and  any  following IP or PORT
              instructions also match, the following USE instruction  will  be
              used--otherwise  it  will  not.   supported  protocols are: any,
              input,  ascii,  extended-ascii, readable, unreadable, http, ssh, 
              ftp,  smtp,  pop3,  imap  and  auth.  (any  stands for any value
              including  nothing,  input  stands  for  any  value  but must be
              something)


       IF LIKE 'expr'
              - info: located in LISTEN or TRY hierarchy.
              - info: has own hierarchy consisting of:
              IP, IP NOT, PORT, and PORT NOT.
              - info: multiple instances allowed.
              - info: not required.

              if the incoming  connection's  initial  input/data  matches  the
              specified  LIKE  expression  format and any following IP or PORT
              instructions also match, the following USE instruction  will  be
              used--otherwise  it  will not.  the LIKE format is a basic wild-
              card comparison that can allow anything on the left or right  to
              be  wildcard  matched  via  the  '%'  character.   for  example,
              '%test%' would match if  the  connection's  input/data  has  the
              string  'test'  anywhere in the input/data.  this instruction is
              intended for when the IF DEFINED  instruction  has  no  suitable
              pre-defined value associated with the protocol, or you just need
              hands-on matching of the initial data.   this  instruction  sup-
              ports  null-byte  comparisons if needed. (signified by '\x00' or
              '\000')


       IF REGEXP 'expr'
              - info: located in LISTEN or TRY hierarchy.
              - info: has own hierarchy consisting of:
              IP, IP NOT, PORT, and PORT NOT.
              - info: multiple instances allowed.
              - info: not required.

              if the incoming  connection's  initial  input/data  matches  the
              specified the connection's input/data has the string 'test' any-
              where in the input/data.   this  instruction  does  not  support
              null-byte  comparisons,  use  the  IF LIKE instruction for that.
              this instruction is intended for when the IF DEFINED instruction
              has  no suitable pre-defined value associated with the protocol,
              or you just need hands-on matching of the initial data.


       IP [NOT] 'fmt'
              - info: located in IF hierarchy.
              - info: has no hierarchy of its own.
              - info: multiple instances allowed.
              - info: not required.

              if the specified ip format matches, along with any preceding  or
              following  IF  or  PORT  restrictions,  then  the  following USE
              instruction will be used.  the ip format can be specified as  an
              ip    or    a    range.   (ie.   '127.0.0.1',   '127.*.*.*'   or
              '127.1-255.1-255.1-255')


       PORT [NOT] 'fmt'
              - info: located in IF hierarchy.
              - info: has no hierarchy of its own.
              - info: multiple instances allowed.
              - info: not required.

              if the specified port format matches, along with  any  preceding
              or  following  IF  or  IP  restrictions,  then the following USE
              instruction will be used.  the port format can be specified as a
              number or a range of numbers. (ie. '4096' or '4000-4100')


       USE 'hostname:port|-'
              - info: located in LISTEN, TRY or IF hierarchy.
              - info: has no hierarchy of its own.
              - info: multiple instances allowed.
              - info: not required. (pointless service without at least one)

              sets  the final forwarding location for the incoming connection,
              once this instruction has been executed  no  other  instructions
              will be processed for the current connection.  if '-' is used it
              will assume the active forwarding connection  currently  in  use
              from  a  previous  TRY instruction.  (info: 'hostname' can be an
              ip; 'port' can be the protocol string representation, instead of
              the numeric port)


       TRY 'hostname:port'
              - info: located in LISTEN hierarchy.
              - info: has own hierarchy consisting of:
              WRITE, TIMEOUT, and IF.
              - info: multiple instances allowed.
              - info: not required.

              sets  a (temporary) forward to forward data to the incoming con-
              nection in an attempt to invoke initial data from  the  incoming
              connection.   this  instruction  is  intended for protocols that
              expect the server to send the initial data first.  USE '-'  will
              commit the last TRY instruction as the (final) forward location.
              (info: 'hostname' can be an  ip;  'port'  can  be  the  protocol
              string representation, instead of the numeric port)

BUGS
       ftp and pop3 both expect the same initial input data ("USER username"),
       therefore they should not be used together in the same LISTEN block.
