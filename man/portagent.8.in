.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP 
\fBportagent\fR is a POSIX transparent proxy routing daemon that allows multiple arbitrary services to run on a single arbitrary port. The main intention of \fBportagent\fR is for situations that need more services open to the world than open ports prohibit.

\fBportagent\fR works by analyzing the first input sent to the proxy (\fBportagent\fR) then, based on that input, forwards the connection to a defined location; this makes \fBportagent\fR more of an art than a science.  certain protocols work well together, and the more services on a single port the more degradation may occur.

some protocols expect the client to send data first, for example http/80 sends its request without expecting any data from the server, this is desired, and can be matched and forwarded immediately.  on the other side a service like ssh/22 expects the server to send data first, for this \fBportagent\fR will 'tease' the client with a forwarded connection (using the \fBTRY\fR instruction listed further on) so that the server will send data to the client in an attempt to invoke a response from client to then be matched and forwarded.

the science part of \fBportagent\fR comes into play when using multiple \fBTRY\fR instructions to attempt to invoke a response from the client, by the second \fBTRY\fR instruction the connection will have invalid protocol data sent to it from the previous \fBTRY\fR, however this may or may not matter depending on the protocol.  if a protocol is broken by this, it is usually easily noticeable when debugging/testing a portagent config file. 

\fBportagent\fR config options have the following basic format: \fBINSTRUCTION_NAME 'instruction_value'\fR, where \fBinstruction_value\fR may contain the following escape codes: \\\\, \\', \\e, \\v, \\t, \\r, \\n, \\xNN, and \\NNN.

\fBportagent\fR config files themselves have a very flexible instruction hierarchy, a whole config file could be placed on one line with no spaces if needed.  however, it is best understood in the following schema (format):

(items in '[]' indicate they are not required, '...' indicates allowance for multiple hierarchy instances, '|' indicates one of two choices)

.br
if the incoming connection's initial input/data matches the specified pre\-defined protocol and any following \fBIP\fR or \fBPORT\fR instructions also match, the following \fBUSE\fR instruction will be used\-\-otherwise it will not.  supported protocols are: \fIany\fR, \fIinput\fR, \fIascii\fR, \fIextended-ascii\fR, \fIreadable\fR, \fIunreadable\fR, \fIhttp\fR, \fIssh\fR, \fIftp\fR, \fIsmtp\fR, \fIpop3\fR, \fIimap\fR, and \fIauth\fR.

.br
if the incoming connection's initial input/data matches the specified \fBLIKE\fR expression format and any following \fBIP\fR or \fBPORT\fR instructions also match, the following \fBUSE\fR instruction will be used\-\-otherwise it will not.  the LIKE format is a basic wildcard comparison that can allow anything on the left or right to be wildcard matched via the '%' character.  for example, '%test%' would match if the connection's input/data has the string 'test' anywhere in the input/data.  this instruction is intended for when the \fBIF DEFINED\fR instruction has no suitable pre-defined value associated with the protocol, or you just need hands-on matching of the initial data.  this instruction supports null\-byte comparisons if needed. (signified by '\\x00' or '\\000')
