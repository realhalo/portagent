- add more IF DEFINED internals as they come and can be supported:
-   https, nmbd, x11, nntp, socks4/5 proxy, http proxy, mysql, openvpn, lpd, snmp, ldap?, telnet?, finger?, cups?, gopher (for old times sake)
- possibly add UDP support, although its use seems limited.
- possibly add IPV6 support, but the whole point of portagent is for ipv4/firewall restrictions...could still have a use in the future though.
- possibly add bandwidth throttle, although it doesn't seem like portagent's roll.

- possibly add a REWRITE instruction, on-the-fly stream modification, not sure if it's needed for anything yet.
- stress test queue/etc(cut off the sender in the middle, hangs when it should give up--only frees when the server disconnects):
	nc -lp 8080 >/dev/null 
	cat /dev/urandom|nc 0 4040

- pre-connected send/queueing of data, make sure it's triggered to start the send queue chain at some point once it's turned to connected
- add a NO INITIAL SEND option
- add KEY 'password' a and IF KEY 'password' or similar

- find memory leaks
`- causes encrypt/decrypt failure afterwords, from one side--no data sent, doesnt disconnect

- default MAX QUEUE to non-infinie? can be abused possibly

- perhaps make KEY SERVER/CLIENT at the root level, list of keys needed
